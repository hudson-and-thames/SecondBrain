# Exploitation of Model Distribution
Ensemble Learning works best when base models are not correlated:
Combine different models based on distribution of outputs (e.g. max margin classifiers like Boosting and SVM with Naive Bayes) to maximise the data exploitation.

This idea was inspired by the calibration plots and the shape of the distributions of the model outputs (probabilities), from [[Probability Calibration]] and has applications for [[MLA Calibration]].
