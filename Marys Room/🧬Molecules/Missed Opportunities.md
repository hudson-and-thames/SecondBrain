# Missed Opportunities
[[Meta-Labeling]] is a filtering mechanism in that it only filters out bad trades and it can't produce any new signals. 

By investigating missed opportunities, i.e., trades that you should have taken but didn't, you may be able to add new signals to the strategy that can then be filtered via meta-labeling.

We can fit a model for [[Inverted Meta-Labels]] to find these trades and it relates to the [[Information Advantage]] in [[3 Sources of Advantage (MLA)]]. 

Note that the missed opportunities here refer to the missed good trades in the [[Primary Model]]. You could also used missed opportunities of a secondary model if you are using a recursive architecture as discussed by Michael. This falls under [[MLA Architecture]].
