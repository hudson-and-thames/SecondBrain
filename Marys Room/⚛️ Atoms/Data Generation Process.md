# Data Generation Process
## Key Concept
In statistics and in empirical sciences, a **data generating process** is a process in the real world that "generates" the data one is interested in. Usually, scholars do not know the real data generating [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_model "Statistical model"). However, it is assumed that those real models have observable consequences. Those consequences are the [distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_distribution "Frequency distribution") of the data in the [population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_population "Statistical population"). Those distributors or models can be represented via [mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_function "Mathematical function"). There are many functions of data distribution. For example, [normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution "Normal distribution"), [Bernoulli distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution "Bernoulli distribution"), [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution "Poisson distribution"), etc.
