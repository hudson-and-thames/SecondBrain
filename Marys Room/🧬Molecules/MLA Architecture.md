# MLA Architecture

A [[Machine Learning]] model architecture  defines the way in which the various layers involved (input, model type, output etc.) are set up and interact with each other. A model architecture is the the bigger picture of the machine learning process, or the overall approach to solving the problem at hand

The idea is to great new architectures for [[Meta-Labeling]]. Some of the inspiration comes from [[Ensemble]]. Ideas of this are [[Long-Short MLA]], [[Conditional MLA]]], [[Sequential MLA]]. [[Inverted Meta-Labels]], [[Missed Opportunities]]
