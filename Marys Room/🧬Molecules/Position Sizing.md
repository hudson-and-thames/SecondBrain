# Position Sizing
Position sizing is the 3rd of the [[3 Sources of Advantage (MLA)]] in [[Meta-Labeling]].

The M3 model is responsible of position sizing. It takes as one of its inputs the model output of the secondary model and then provides a position size. 

It could be an optimization which focuses on reducing drawdowns or maximizing the Sharpe ratio or capital growth. This also allows for the development of sophisticated structures and may potentially aid in the development of [[MLA Architecture]].

The process is greatly improved if [[MLA Calibration]] is successfully employed.

Some examples of position sizing algorithms are the:
* ECDF(y_prob)
* [[Kelly Criterion]]
* All of nothing $[0, 1]$
