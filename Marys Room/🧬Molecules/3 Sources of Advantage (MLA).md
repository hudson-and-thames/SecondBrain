# 3 Sources of Advantage (MLA)

There are 3 sources of advantage when [[Meta-Labeling]]: 
1. [[Information Advantage]]: This is the additional information that a secondary model model is able to learn, that the primary model couldn't. [[Inverted Meta-Labels]] should be applied if this source is present.
2. [[Modeling for False Positives]]:
	1. Recent model performance of M1
	2. Market state features such as regime change. Under what conditions does the primary model, not perform well in.
3. [[Position Sizing]]
	1. Once [[MLA Calibration]] has been performed, position sizing algorithms such as the [[Kelly Criterion]] can be applied to optimally size positions.


## Question:
Are there [[other sources of advantage]] or a better way to do attribution in meta-labeling?
