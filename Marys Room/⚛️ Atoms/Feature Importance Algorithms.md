# Feature Importance Algorithms
## Key Concept
Feature Importance refers to **techniques that calculate a score for all the input features for a given model** — the scores simply represent the “importance” of each feature. A higher score means that the specific feature will have a larger effect on the model that is being used to predict a certain variable.

Examples:
* Model Fingerprint (Yimou, Turkington, Yazdani 2020)
* Clustered Mean Decrease Accuracy (CMDA) (Lopez de Prado 2020)
* Shapley Values
