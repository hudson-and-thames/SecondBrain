# Knowledge Graph

"A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge." [Towards a Definition of Knowledge Graphs](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1695/paper4.pdf)

"Think of it more of an abstract framework than a mathematical structure.""

A key way this differs from a knowledge base (e.g., an ontology), is the addition of a [[Reasoning Engine]] to generate new knowledge and integrates one or more information sources!

My definition: 
A knowledge graph is a [[Graph]] data structure which uses an [[Ontology]] (blueprint for the graph) of how a subject relates to an object and populates it with information (knowledge). Enables powerful capabilities such as semantic search.

"Employing well designed subject ontologies (requires human expertise), information becomes semantic, allowing knowledge graphs to accurately encode and organize domain-specific information in a meaningful way.

By using a knowledge graphs, you can infer and communicate new facts, producing new knowledge!" [Silverchair](https://www.silverchair.com/news/knowledge-graphs-academic-publishing/)

Our use case of a knowledge graph is to accelerate our team's ability to come up with new ideas and unique insights, in a tool we call [[Marys Room]].

Google is a large knowledge graph:

To create a knowledge graph:
1. Start with a taxonomy
2. Create the [[Ontology]]
3. Add knowledge to create the graph

**Note:**
* "Wikipedia is a primary information source for many prominent knowledge representation apps." [Towards a Definition of Knowledge Graphs](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1695/paper4.pdf)
* Some describe a KG as an [[Resource Description Framework (RDF)]] graph. (Faber et al)
* Obsidian is a Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG) tool.
