# Source
A **Source** is any medium of information that I want to learn from. The main types of Sources that I deal with are non-fiction books, textbooks, podcasts, online courses and YouTube videos.

It is 1 of 3 primitives of [[Molecular Notes]], the other primitives are [[Atoms]] and [[Molecules]].
