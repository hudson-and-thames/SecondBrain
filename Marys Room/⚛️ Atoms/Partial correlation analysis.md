Partial correlation analysis is the study of correlations that emerge between two variables, e.g., stock returns as a  result of their correlation with a third variable. The partial correlation between two variables is calculated after their correlation with the third variable has been suitably removed. If the resulting partial correlation is significantly  
smaller than the original correlation, this indicates that the correlation between  the two variables was mostly due to their individual correlation with the third variable.

Partial correlation neworks according to literature are the Partial Correlation Threshold  
Network (PCTN), and the Partial Correlation Planar maximally filtered Graph (PCPG).
