**A sample** is a subset of data from a larger data set; statisticians call this larger data set the population. A population in statistics is not the same thing as in biology—it is a large, defined (but sometimes theoretical or imaginary) set of data.

**Random sampling** is a process in which each available member of the population being sampled has an equal chance of being chosen for the sample at each draw. The sample that results is called a simple random sample. Sampling can be done with replacement, in which observations are put back in the population after each draw for possible future reselection. Or it can be done without replacement, in which case observations, once selected, are unavailable for future draws.

**Statistical bias** refers to measurement or sampling errors that are systematic and pro‐ duced by the measurement or sampling process.
