# Molecules
(similar to “zettels” in the Zettelkasten system): crystallised insights, pieces of intuition, links between [[Atoms]], my ideas.

Molecules are typically only a couple of sentences – a paragraph at most. In most cases, a Molecule will “build on” one or more Atoms

**Molecules** are _insights_ – either my own, or an insight I have internalised from a particular Source. Creating Molecules is the primary goal of Molecular Notes!
