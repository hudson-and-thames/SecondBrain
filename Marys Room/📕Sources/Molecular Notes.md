A [[Second Brain]] is a [[Knowledge Graph]] for consuming and interacting with information (specifically, concepts and ideas) that we care about.

Molecular Notes aims to: **Mine Atoms out of Sources, make Molecules out of Atoms, organise everything with Topics.**

This also defines the [[classes]] of the [[Ontology]]: [[Atoms]] are mined from a [[Source]], so that new ideas and insights can be crystalized as [[Molecules]].

The goal is not to take better notes, the goal is better thinking! (Andy Matuschak)

## Objectives
Use the [[Hook model]] to create this new habit.
* Trigger
* Action
* Reward
* Time Investment

Objectives of a 2nd Brain: 
1. Rapidly learning complex topics from mixed media forms
2. Retaining insights and understanding
3. O($n^2$) growth
4. Synthesising new ideas
5. Encouraging positive learning habits

## Molecular Notes for teams
Tips:
- The team is small
- Everyone follows conventions
- The team puts a lot of effort into maintaining maps of content, essential to allow someone to quickly review what is in the brain.

## Source
Any [[Source]] of information.

- Concepts - These become [[Atoms]]
- Thesis: Author commentary/explanation on how concepts to link.
- Examples and context

## Atom
Existing concepts or techniques that we extract from sources.

Represents an existing concept, technique, formula, framework, historical event, or historical figure. It is a piece of knowledge that doesn’t “belong” to me – it already exists, and the Atom is merely an explanation of it in my own words.

The functions of an Atom are threefold. It must:

1.  Explain the concept to me.
2.  Show how that piece of knowledge fits in with other Atoms.
3.  Point to resources, if need more info.

## Molecule
Crystallised insights, pieces of intuition, links between Atoms, and novel ideas. Considered permanent notes in the [[Zettelkasten system]].

Don't have to be novel ideas / insights.

Common types:
1. Original insights inspired two by sources or atoms
2. Links between two sources or two atoms
3. Intelligent pieces of commentary relating to a source or atom

> "I will typically only make something a Molecule (rather than just a bullet point in the Source) if I feel like I have internalised the idea to the point where I would be comfortable calling it a piece of “my” intuition." Robert Martin

## Topics
Those are just Vertices that help to create structure in the graph. Examples: Finance, Machine Learning, Linear Algebra.

## Failure Modes
-   Categorisation hell
-   Completionism
-   Complicated metadata
-   Copy-pasting content
-   Not being intentional about note-taking
