# Idea Debt and refactoring
The [[Molecular Notes]] system draws parallels with software engineering best practices. Just like software development accrues tech debt over time, so too can the knowledge graph accrue ideas debt, where the links to nodes and ideas get out dated and require refactoring. 

For example, too many links in a graph is just as bad as too few, so when this occurs, the graph needs to be refactored by introducing new maps of content and topics.

## Idea Ratings

Not all ideas are equal and a rating system should be used to highlight very good ideas. Think of it as a 5 star system or some other kind of ranking.

This idea was from Prof Ben Herbst, and can link to Atoms and Molecules.
