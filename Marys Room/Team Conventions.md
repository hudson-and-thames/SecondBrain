# Team Conventions

![[Team-scaled.jpg]]

There is a lot of information to take in when you are just starting out. Please review [[Marys Setup]], [[Team Conventions]] and [[Tips]] regularly and if you ever feel uncertain about something. If you come across something that you feel might help someone new, please consider adding it to now of aforementioned nodes. 

## General
* You are allowed to rearrange, edit, delete or contribute to existing nodes, just be careful and think about how it will impact everything.
* Regularly review [[Team Conventions]].
* Complete notes before moving on to another. Otherwise there will sometimes be empty or incomplete nodes that you forget about.
- If you don't want to complete a node, consider making it a [[Particles]] and working on it later then.
- Alternatively tag yourself in the node so that we know its a node in progress.
* Try to include pictures. 
* When writing a new note and you are talking about an important concept that does yet have a atom or molecule, reference the topic anyway. This will create concepts that need to be written up on or explored in the future.
* Make sure to explain the key concept of the atom at the start in as simple terms as possible.
* Avoid duplication. If a concept is already explained somewhere else, rather reference it or consider making it a new atom.
* As a rule of thumb, a node should not contain more than 3-4 links.
* More than one Topic can be included, but only link the most relevant one.
* Under the Tables folder go to [[Tagged Content]] or [[Discussion]] so see if someone wants you to take a look at something.
* Try to write atoms or molecules in you own words.
* Review daily changes in the tables to see what everyone is working.
* Try to come up with some novel concepts by looking at the graph and trying to connect nodes!
- Tag someone if you edit their node or if you think they will be interested.
- If you want someone else to read a note tag them in `TAF ::` or 'Tag a Friend'. When you have read it, simply remove your name.
- Tags are created as follows Key :: Value.
- You can tag as many topics as you want, but only like the most relevant one.

## Molecules
- Tag Molecules as novel or not. This makes it clear which molecules can be used to write a paper or gain an edge.
*  If you have a novel molecule then you should add a rating to it.
*  Ratings works as follow
	* 7-10 : You have a clear understanding of the idea or project that can be extracted from the molecule and it can be very useful. For example, an idea for a paper or a potential beneficial project.
	* 4-6 : Can be a good idea that has potential but the details still need to be fleshed out.
	* 1-3 : Just an idea that not a lot of thought has gone into.

## Discussions
- If you have read some note and you will like to discuss it with someone, create a new section called 'Discussion' at the bottom of the page.
- The following format should be used in a topic:

	Michael: Hey how does this discussion section work?
	
	Jacques : Simply write it in this format!

- When creating a Discussion, three meta data tags should also be created:
	- `Discussion`, and tag the persons you want to have the discussion with.
	- `Dis_Topic`, the topic for discussion
	- `Resolved`, the value should be 'Yes' if the topic has been resolved.

- You can the either delete the discussion section or leave it if you think it will be relevant in the future.

## Conclusion

This may seem like a lot of rules and a bit complicated but you will get used to quickly. Let the creativity start flowing!
