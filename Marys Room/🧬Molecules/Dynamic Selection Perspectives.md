# Dynamic Selection Perspectives
*Pool generation*
- Definition of classifier generation procedure that takes into account the local information is very promising research direction in order to improve the performance of all Dynamic Selection techniques
- Meta-regression model to predict the best size of the pool of classifiers based on complexity measures extracted from classifier problem
*Region of competence definition*
- How does distribution of region of competence change the way the competence of the base classifiers is estimated?
- Use relationship to define new ways of demarcating the region of competence and selecting classifiers
- relationship taken into account during the classifier generation procedure
- Ensemble generation technique that maximizes the number of base classifiers with decision boundaries crossing the indecision regions (= borderline samples of different classes)
*Cost-sensitive dynamic selection*
- Define a cost-sensitive Dynamic Classification Selection and Dynamic Ensemble Selection technique
