# Second Brain
A Second Brain is a system for consuming and interacting with information (specifically, concepts and ideas) that we care about.

> Fancy note taking system that is good at helping the user identify new and creative solutions.

Objectives:
* Rapidly achieve the same level of understanding about something that I once had in the past
* Facilitate novel perspectives and creativity.
* Access the imagination of your colleagues!

For links, the question is, **in what context do I want to stumble upon it again?**
