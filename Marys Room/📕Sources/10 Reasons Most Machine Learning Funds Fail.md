The 7 Reasons:
1.  Working in Silos (The Sisyphean Quants)
	1. Solution: The Meta-Strategy Paradigm
2. Research Through Backtesting
	1. Solution: Feature Importance Analysis
3. Inefficient Sampling, Chronological Sampling
	1. Solution: The Volume Clock
4.  Integer Differentiation (Stationarity vs. Memory Dilemma)
	1. Solution: Fractional Differentiation
5.  Wrong Labeling: Fixed Time Horizon
	1. Solution: Triple-Barrier Method
6. Learning Side and Size Simultaneously
	1. Solution: [[Meta-Labeling]] 
7.  Weighting of non-IID samples
	1. Solution: Uniqueness Weighting and Sequential Bootstrapping
8.  [[Cross-Validation Leakage]]
	1. Solution: [[Purging and Embargoing]] CV
9. Walk-Forward Backtesting
	1. Solution: Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation 
10.  Backtest Overfitting
	1. Solution: The Deflated Sharpe Ratio
