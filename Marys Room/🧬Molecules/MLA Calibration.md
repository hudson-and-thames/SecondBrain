# MLA Calibration
[[Probability Calibration]] methods can be used in [[Meta-Labeling]] (MLA) in order to transform the M2 model output into a frequentist probability, which if successful, means that bet sizing algorithms like the [[Kelly Criterion]] can be more effective.

Exhibit 2 highlights the base architecture for MLA, the calibration would be for $\hat Y$ and the transformation would then be passed to M3 for optimal position sizing. 

Note: This is the topic for Illya and Jacques' paper.

Alternativley, T from Exhibit 2 can be adjusted and Exhibit 4 shows the affect on the Sharpe Ratio. From Joubert 2022.
