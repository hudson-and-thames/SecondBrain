# Data Preparation / Wrangling

Data Science project starts with a business question and collecting and preparing data.

Usually done in step with the [[Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)]]. 

Often the most consuming part of the project, representing about 50-70% of the time.

Cleaning data and reshaping it into a usable form.
* Fill missing values.
* Merge and wrangle data until [[Tidy Data]].
* Identify categorical, ordinal, and numerical data.
* Drop features with only 1 value.
* Decide what to do with highly correlated features.
* Identify feature engineering techniques needed.
* Identify what transformations need to be applied, for example: One-Hot-Encoding or StandardScalar.
* Data augmentation.
* Labeling your target variable
* Validating your data
