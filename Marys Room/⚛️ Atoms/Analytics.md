Analytics is the science of applying a structured method to solve a business problem using data and analysis to drive impact. Analytics is not just about data, but about decisions.

Intuition + Data = Powerful insights → Good decision

Industry leaders like Procter & Gamble, Amazon, LinkedIn, and Capital One have dominated their fields by deploying data-led, hypothesis-driven, and analytics-powered strategies backed by vision and intuition. 

Data is an ocean, and hypotheses help to narrow down where to find the most likely answers. Hypotheses are generated by human intuition based on the collective intelligence and experience of stakeholders and their understanding of the business and their environment. Data validates the hypotheses to come up with a convergent solution. The strength of the solution then will lie in the best of both—data and hypotheses.

You don’t have to know all the answers to the guided questions you are asking. You can construct a solid hypothesis based on what you have already learned, partial as it may be, and then use that hypothesis to identify the most likely problem suspects.

* Data science: This is the technical track, designed to derive insights from data.
* Decision science: This is the business track, designed to align stakeholders so that the valuable insights produced using the data science track can be inserted into the decision-making process and converted into action.

* Business analytics: The use of simpler analytics methodologies on past data. 
* Advanced analytics: Everything else, including predictive analytics.
