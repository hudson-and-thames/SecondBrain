# Graphs and Metrics

## Graph Manager
The champion / leader / product owner of the company knowledge graph / [[Molecular Notes]]. This person makes key decisions, splits all ties, and sets the [[Team Conventions]].

The are responsible for maintaining the health of the graph, i.e., Idea Debt and Refactoring.

## Graph KPIs
Graph metrics can be used to help manage the knowledge graph, and signal when [[Idea Debt and Refactoring]] is needed. 

Some examples of metrics include: 
* Degree
* Distance
* Connectivity
* Centrality
* Similarity

Can setup a Graph Health Dashboard.

## Graph Views
A graph view is a visual representation of the knowledge graph, to help answer particular questions and draw insights.

The meta data of the nodes can be used to create a view. For example: the number of times a node is visited can be shown in the size of the node, or the number of connections leading into a node. 

The most visited nodes may not contain unique insights and so we may turn to an entropy measure to find unique ideas.

Closely related to Graph Health Dashboard.

# Graph Health Dashboard
A dashboard of Graph KPIs built in python (Dash, Plotly), that represent the knowledge graph and help the [[Graph and Metrics]] to make key decisions.
