# Feature Driven Architectures
Lopez de Prado notes in [[Advances in Financial Machine Learning]] (w.r.t [[Meta-Labeling]]) that "by separating the side from the size prediction, sophisticated strategy structures can be developed. For example, the features driving a market rally may be different from those of a panic sell-off."

This highlights that [[MLA Architecture]] may be driven by the data generating process. Ensemble techniques such as [[Boosting]] are one such example. So is a different model for longs than for shorts. [[Dynamic Ensemble Selection]] may be another example.

The features from [[Modeling for False Positives]] in [[3 Sources of Advantage (MLA)]], can be used to guide build a model architecture. Such as the recent performance of the primary model or market state features.
