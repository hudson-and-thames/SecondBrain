# To-Do list

These the are the to-do items regarding work in Obsidian.
You can add tasks in any nodes and it will publicly available here, or you can simply add tasks here.

- [ ] External instruction document before installing Obsidian.
- [x] How should task be split between Click Up and here
- [ ]  Link this Obsidian to a website. Should be compatible to tag someone in Slack if needed.
- [ ] Find a way so that each individuals can see the nodes that they have explored or yet to explore.
- [x] System of introduction, when on-boarding let users create a atom,molecule source node etc. so that they get used to the idea.
- [ ] When novel molecules have become fully fledged ideas and have been implemented, maybe another tag to show they are done?
- [x] Should personal projects or ideas be included that are relevant to H&T? The idea as that the graph will grow but the material may not necessarily be relevant. For example if I develop a strategy it would be useful for everyone else to have access to it. Also people could jump on board on the idea or project.
