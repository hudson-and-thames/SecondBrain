# MLA for Multi Trade Strategies

How can MLA be applied to strategies where there are simultaneous trades, or even if are sophisticated strategies that look at multiple asset classes? 

For example, in a long-short strategy where you would take opposite positions on certain stocks, would it simply be still on the labels indicating which one should you would short or buy (in a pairs scenario) ? What about the position sizing algorithm? Could the M3 model determine the hedge ratio then? 

What if you have multiple pairs that you trade, then applying MLA you filter out only the pairs that you actually traded on the training set, but then in real time you would filter out a pair chosen by the algorithm, giving oppurtunity to select another pair, but that is not accounted for when filtering out false positives.
