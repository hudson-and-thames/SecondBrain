# Atom

An **Atom** represents an existing concept, technique, formula, framework, historical event, or historical figure. It is a piece of knowledge that doesn’t “belong” to me – it already exists, and the Atom is merely an explanation of it in my own words.

As a rule of thumb, Atoms are pieces of knowledge that could have their own Wikipedia page.

Extract concepts into individual notes – **Atoms** – and link to them from the Source.

The functions of an Atom are threefold. It must:

1.  Explain the concept to me, such that I can rapidly resume a level of understanding I once had (Objective #2 – _Retaining insights and understanding_)
2. Show how that piece of knowledge fits in with other Atoms (Objective #1 – _Rapidly learning complex topics_; Objective #3 – O(N2)O(N2) _growth_).
3. Point to resources should I need more detail. Attached to each Atom should be a link to some Source (or even just a wiki page / URL) with the “best” explanation I can find for the concept.
