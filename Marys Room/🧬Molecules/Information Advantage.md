# Information Advantage
Information Advantage is the 1st of [[3 Sources of Advantage (MLA)]] in [[Meta-Labeling]].

It is the additional information that a secondary model model is able to learn, that the [[Primary Model]] couldn't.

A toy example is a primary model that uses only the last days return direction as the trading signal. A logistic regression fit on the last 3 returns may better exploit the information in the data and thus lead to an increase in performance of the trading strategy.

This is illustrated in Joubert 2022.

[[Inverted Meta-Labels]] should be applied if this source is present.
