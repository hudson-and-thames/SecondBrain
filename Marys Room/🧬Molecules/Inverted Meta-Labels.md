# Inverted Meta-Labels
**Good idea!** 

Think of this concept as the opposite of [[Meta-Labeling]]: can we build a model to identify [[Missed Opportunities]]?

Since meta-labeling is a filtering mechanism, it can't add any new signals, however we can add new signals if inverted meta-labels are able to identify missed opportunities. 

If there exists an [[Information Advantage]], as described in [[3 Sources of Advantage (MLA)]], then the strategy will benefit from additional trades!

These missed opportunities are then passed to the secondary model for filtering.

Question: 
* How does this relate to the [[Strategy Risk Template]]? Can we identify the relationship between the sharpe ratio and taking more winning trades? Yes we can, it is equivalent to increasing $n$, where $n$ is the number of trades. Higher $n$ results in a steeper curve, thus a change in precision has a greater impact on extracting more Sharpe Ratio!!
* I think we can add an [[MLA Architecture]] diagram for this is a sophisticated strategy?
