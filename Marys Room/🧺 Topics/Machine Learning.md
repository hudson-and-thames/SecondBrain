## Discussion
Michael : Since you are working on intro to ML and lecturing it, feel free add any insights
Jacques: Should this not rather be a source that splits into atoms? I thought the idea was to use this node as a Map of Content?
Michael : Yes I just wanted to give a synopsis of it but explained to much. Will change it.
