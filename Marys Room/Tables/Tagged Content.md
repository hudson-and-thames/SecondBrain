# Content that you are tagged in

Here you can see the content that someone has tagged you in. TAF or 'Tag a Friend' is a way for you show someone what you are working on or that they might find interesting.

```dataview
TABLE Topics ,TAF
where TAF != None
```

```ad-note
If you have read through the content and feel that you no longer need to be tagged, just remove yourself from TAF
