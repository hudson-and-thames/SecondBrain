## Basic Tips
- Use `ctrl + N` to open a new note, type in the title and then use `ctrl + T` (or the hotkey that you specified) to insert a new template. The title and date will automatically be filled in.
-  To insert an image, download the image and copy it into the attachments folder and use ![[]] with the image name inside.  
- The admonition plugin lets you make beautiful boxes, for example
```ad-note 
This is way to represent a note. See admonition for other types of boxes 
```
The following admonition types are currently supported:
``` 
note
abstract 
info
tip
success
question
warning
failure
danger
bug
example
quote
```

## Graph view
- When in graph view right click on a node and select `Open a new pane` to open the note side by side with the graph.
- In `graph settings` under `Filters` there a couple of interesting features that you can use. Search for topics with `line()` or a section with `section`.
- Toggle `Existing files only` off to display topics or concepts yet to be explored. 
- `Orphans` in this case are the particles.
- Right click on a node and select  `Open local graph`. This will show a graph that is centred around the the selected graph.
		Under the filters tab there are couple of additional features. `Depth` shows you the maximum connection length. `Incoming links` and `Outgoing links` shows how the links are referenced.
