# Reasoning Engine

A mechanism in the [[Knowledge Graph]] which enables the user to generate new knowledge and integrates one or more sources. 

An example of the reasoning engine inside of Googles knowledge graph is its [[semantic search]] abilities which enables users to answer questions, derive new insights, and solve real world problems.

In the context of [[Marys Room]], the reasoning engine is created by adding the [DataView](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) plugin to Obsidian, this allows us to add meta data (think [[Ontology]]), and then to traverse, search, filter, and find new insights. The Graph Analytics plugin pushes semantic reasoning further by enabling link prediction, similarity, centrality, co-citations, and community detection.
