## Key Findings
- Bias and variance as factors of CV model selection
- Leave-one-out best risk estimator, 10-fold CV more accurate for model selection    
- cross-validation paradox: larger proportion of data should be put in validation set for model selection    
- modified CV for time dependent data (Chu and Marron 1991)    
- Meta models: perform model selection in two steps (Arlot and Celisse 2009)    
- optimal amount of data splits remains open question
