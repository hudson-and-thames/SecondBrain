# Zettelkasten system

**A system of note-taking and personal knowledge management used in research and study. Particularly useful in coming up with novel ideas and writing papers.**

Invented by: Niklas Luhmann

3 Types of notes:
1. Free ideas
2. Literature notes
3. Permanent notes (Zettles)

[[Molecular Notes]] are inspired largely by this technique and it is a note taking technique used in developing a [[Second Brain]].
