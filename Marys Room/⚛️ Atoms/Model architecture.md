# Model Architecture

The machine learning architecture defines the various layers involved in the machine learning cycle and involves the major steps being carried out in the overall model. It is important to note that the architecture and models are not the same. The architecture can be thought of as the overall approach to solve the problem while models are one piece of your architecture; a specific instance that trains on a chosen set of data. For example, in a neural net, the trained weights of each node, per the architecture, comprise the model.
