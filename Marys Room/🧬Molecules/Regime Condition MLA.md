# Regime Condition MLA

A natural choice for a [[Conditional MLA]] architecture is to condition on market state and regime related data. Secondary models are applied to a subspace of the original feature space that relates to each specific market state or regime. The unique attributes of each specific state can be modelled by fitting heterogeneous secondary models. Additionally, unique features could be fed into each model that better encapsulates characteristics of each specific state. Another benefit of this architecture is that inference can be drawn on which conditions the primary model is profitable in or not. This architecture is given in the figure below and is called the Regime Conditioned MLA (RCMLA) architecture.
