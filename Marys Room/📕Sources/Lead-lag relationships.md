This paper analysis asynchronous relationships over traditional synchronous relationships of financial instruments.  

Lead-lag relationships of financial instruments are analysed using mutual information instead of Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. The benefit of using [[Mutual information]] is that it quantifies both the linear and non-linear interdependencies between two stochastic processes.  

Intraday as well as daily returns are analysed for lead-lag relationships between stocks. Other similar measures include [[Granger Causality]] and [[Partial correlation analysis]].


### Concepts

Dependency networks can be formed using either threshold-based methods or topological methods. Both have their disadvantages for presenting nested structures within financial markets.

This paper presents a filtering method for the lagged correlation matrix that creates a network of tatistically-validated directed links between stocks returns series. 


### Great Points

Stock returns for intra-day and daily trade that are classified to be validated pairs are on average significantly more predictable than the ones not classified as validated pairs.
