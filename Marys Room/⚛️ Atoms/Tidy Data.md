# Tidy Data

Tidy data isÂ **a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure**. A dataset is messy or tidy depending on how rows, columns and tables are matched up with observations, variables and types. In tidy data: Every column is a variable. Every row is an observation.

Making a data set tidy is part of [[Data Preparation]] and is the starting point for a data science project.
