# Deep Granger Causality assumptions and simplifications
- multivariate time-series applications -> financial (currency pairs)
- **Choice of latent confounder** (no confounder assumed in granger causality *but tends to fail if there is*)
- neural architecture (expand, test, improve...) *NLP and Machine vision with more sophisticated architecture* -> hyperparameter optimisation
- methodology for systematic granger causality testing for multiple pairs (n, how to rank, keep relationships)
- statistical tests for keeping relevant causality relationship (validation of family-wise relation -> **noise**)
- analysis of the causality matrix emerging from the methodology (properties, interpretation, spectrum, network analysis)

## Research Idea
Relationship-based gap:
Testing causality from one variable (time-series) to multiple -> multivariant
confounder for more than two variables, could be any permutation
decide which test to perform and how to rank them:
PCA, linear combination as confounder
one constituent confounder -> loose ambiguity
