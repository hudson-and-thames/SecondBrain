# Strategy Driven Acrhitectures

Instead of using the features ([[Feature Driven Architectures]]) to derive the different architetctures for [[Meta-Labeling]], the [[MLA Architecture]] is driven by the type of primary model or the underlying process. The [[Information Advantage]] could also be utilised by looking at different strategies to determine when these strategies underperform or out perform.

For example, say a statistical arbitrage strategy is used and a trade is initiated when the spread exceeds two standard deviations. The rule could be adjusted to use the one standard deviation which would increase the recall. The MLA could be used to by using additional information to filter out the false positives.
