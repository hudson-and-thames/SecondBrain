# Relationship of F1-score to Sharpe ratio

Since the number of trades can be thought of as recall and the precision of the strategy is just when a trade was profitable or not is there some relationship that can be shown between the F1-score and the Sharpe Ratio?

The idea is that if one can find a threshold to optimize and there exists such a relationship then one could simply use the F1-score to maximize the Sharpe Ratio. [[Optimal threshold for maximizing F1-score]] shows how the optimal threshold can be obtained.

For example if somehow the F1-score can be used in [[Inverted Meta-Labels]] to maximize the trade-off between missed opportunities and trades taken then the maximim Sharpe ratio can also be found.
