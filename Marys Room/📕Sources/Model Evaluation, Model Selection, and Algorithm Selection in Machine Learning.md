## Key Findings
- target predictions for independent test sets    
- fitting and evaluating models via cross-validation    
- hypothesis --> significance threshold --> compute statistics --> accept/reject    
- omnibus test for multiple hypotheses    
- Testing scenarios dis-/advantages (p.43)    
- Effect size: theoretical significance doesn't imply practical significance
