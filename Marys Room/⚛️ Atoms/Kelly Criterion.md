# Kelly Criterion
An optimal position sizing algorithm based on capital growth theory. It requires the probability of success and the expeted payouts and losses. **This algorithm is proven to be growth optimal, i.e., no other algorithm will outperform it in an infinately long time line, however it has savage drawdowns.**

It can be in the descrete or continuous form, or the betting vs investing setting. Each one of these has their own formula.
