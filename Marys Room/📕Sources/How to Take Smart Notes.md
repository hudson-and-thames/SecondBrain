[[Zettelkasten system]] is a good system for coming up with new ideas and insights.

## The Method For Smart Notes
1. Take fleeting notes while you read, watch, listen.
2. Be selective with what you write down (Purposeful)
3. Make notes permanent - connect them, develop them, support them, argue for and against them.
4. Link and transfer and associate between the notes you create.
5. When you need to write a paper: you can structure and build what you write around the notes you have already developed.

## Core Ideas
These core ideas may be useful in creating a set of [[Team Conventions]] for a group system.

- We need a simple and reliable external structure to think in that compensates for the limitation of our brain! This is our [[Second Brain]].
- Idea is not to collect but to develop your own ideas.
- For links, the question is, **in what context do I want to stumble upon it again?**
- Importance of curating nodes / ideas. Not everything is worth a permanent note.
- [[Particles]] need an expiry date, if not reviewed in time, they get deleted. (You will forget what the idea is about if you leave it for too long.)
* Academic writing is not a linear process. You need to mine ideas and insights long before you need to come up with an ideas for a topic for a paper. 
* Second Brain's usefulness grows with its size.
* **Writing in your own words is crucial to learning! Elaboration is key.**

## Summary of Key Points
* **There is no such thing as starting from scratch.**
	* You always start from experience / prior knowledge.
	* Writing doesn't start with a blank page.
	* Creativity emerges slowly over time, incremental improvement.
* **Allow yourself to get very interested in topics**
	* Focus on what you find interesting, both wide and narrow.
	* Interest drives effort.
* **We encounter ideas constantly. Capture them!**
	* Keep pen and paper in pocket.
	* Write down (fleeting notes)
* **Simple structures allow complex content**
	* Tools are only as good as our ability to work with them.
	* Good structure -> enables flow.
	* "Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us."
* **Notes must be processed quickly**
	* Processed within a day or forget context.
* **When reading, must think beyond the text**
	* Consider what is not said or not argued.
* **Don't be a planner - have a structure and be an expert**
	* "How do you plan for insight which, by definition, cannot be anticipated?"
	* Our ability to be creative relies on the ability to make abstractions
* **Gain insight, then make it public**
	* "An idea kept private is as good as one you never had"
* **Enter Into The [[Hermeneutic Circle]]**
	* Process of understanding a text hermeneutically.
		* Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially the interpretation of biblical texts, wisdom literature, and philosophical texts
	* Refers to the idea that one's understanding of the text as a whole is established by reference to the individual parts and one's understanding of each individual part by reference to the whole

## Note:
* The book Getting Things Done (GTD) is a good technique for productivity but not for coming up with new ideas.
