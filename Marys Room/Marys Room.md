Mary's room is an external structure ([[Knowledge Graph]]), to think in, that compensates for the limitations of our own minds. It is a space that enables better thinking by allowing our team to share and collect concepts that link together in a knowledge graph.

The usefulness of the space grows as new ideas are added and new connections formed. The goal is to facilitate novel perspectives, creativity, and to access the imagination of your peers.

Constantly ask your self: "**In what context do I want to stumble upon this idea?**"

### Objectives:
* Rapidly achieve the same level of understanding about something that we once had.
* Facilitate novel perspectives and creativity.
* Access the imagination of your colleagues!
* Publish research and create intellectual property of another calibre!

## Background
Mary's room is tightly coupled to Robert Martin's [[Molecular Notes]], which pulls inspiration from the successful [[Zettelkasten system]] and evergreen notes. 

## Navigation guide
Exploring Obsidian can be quite confusing at first, but don't worry it's really easy! We recommend watching the following video to help you familiarise yourself with Obsidian and make it easier for you to navigate. It is not important to understand the Zettelkasten system, but it will assist in your understanding of [[How to Take Smart Notes]].

After you know how to navigate through Obsidian, go to the [[Molecular Notes]] node and read through the content to make sure you understand the concepts of atoms, molecules, and sources. 

Additionally you need to read up on Particles, our own extension. 

```ad-tip
Right-click on a linked word and select *Open in a new pane* to open the note side by side. 
```

The workflow we will use here is slightly different but the concepts remain the same as that of [[Molecular Notes]]. Every node should have a tag to determine the type of node it is. A tag is written with a hashtag before it.

Next you will need to go to [[Marys Setup]] to see how to setup your Obsidian to sync with the team as well as the general structure of everything.

Once everything is setup correctly, it important that you go through the [[Team Conventions]] to make sure you understand the conventions that we will be using. Finally take a look at some helpful [[Tips]] to make your workflow much easier!
