# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A project starts with the [[Data Preparation]] and exploration phase. This allows the analyst to find relationships and evaluate the quality of the data.

Visualise and explore the data to:
* Find patters
* Relationships
* Actionable insights

Useful questions to ask:
* Which attributes are promising for further analysis?
* Has exploration revealed new characteristics about the data?
* How have explorations changed initial hypotheses?
* Can specific subset of data be used later?
* Has the data exploration altered the project?

Tools:
* [Pandas Profiling](https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/index.html)
* [D-Tale](https://github.com/man-group/dtale)
