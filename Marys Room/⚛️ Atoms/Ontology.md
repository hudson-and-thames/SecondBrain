# Ontology

An ontology is a sematic model that represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between these concepts. Think of it as a blue print for your knowledge graph, or as an interface of class Knowledge Graph.

What exists in a a specific field, including the relationships and hierarchy between these parts. Focused on naming parts and processes, and grouping similar ones together into categories.

It is however different to a [[Knowledge Graph]] but both fall into the larger field of [[Information Architectures]].

Made up of [[classes]] and [[relationships]]. Classes are vertices and relationships are edges. Note that the edges here describe the relationship, such as has_employer, is_family, is_university.

**Example**: 
A book is a document that has a topic, publisher, year pub, and author. The relationships are written by, published by, publish date. The ontology is the high level view, its the model. Once you populate the model with information, it becomes a knowledge graph.

An ontology allows us to unlock the power of a knowledge graph by allowing us to do things like traverse, search, and use it as a data structure. The key is high quality meta-data.

2 Standards of ontologies:
1. [[Resource Description Framework (RDF)]]
2. [[Web ontology language (OWL)]]

## Philosophical context 
In a philosophical context: ontology is the study of what exists, in general. Example of ontological question: what are the fundamental parts of the world and how are they related to each other?

Two main branches: 
* Ontological materialism
* Ontological idealism
