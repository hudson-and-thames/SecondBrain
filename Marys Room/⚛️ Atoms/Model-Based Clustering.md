The most widely used model-based clustering methods rest on the multivariate nor‚Äê mal distribution.

### Multivariate Normal Distribution

* The covariance matrix is a measure of how the variables correlate with each other.
* This is a symbolic way of saying that the variables are all normally distributed, and the overall distribution is fully described by the vector of variable means and the covariance matrix.

### Mixtures of Normals
* Each record is assumed to be distributed as one of K multivariate normal distributions.
* Each normal distribution represents a cluster.

### Selecting the Number of Clusters
* Chooses the number of clusters for which the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) has the largest value.
* BIC works by selecting the best-fitting model with a penalty for the number of parameters in the model.
* Adding more clusters will always improve the fit at the expense of introducing additional parameters in the model.
