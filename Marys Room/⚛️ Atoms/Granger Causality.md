# Granger Causality
Granger causality is **a statistical concept of causality that is based on prediction**. According to Granger causality, if a signal X1 "Granger-causes" (or "G-causes") a signal X2, then past values of X1 should contain information that helps predict X2 above and beyond the information contained in past values of X2 alone.
